# 🌊 AWS Sea Temperature Web Application
*A scalable web service to check sea temperatures*

## 🎯 Project Overview
Web application built on AWS to provide real-time sea temperature data with high availability and fault tolerance.

## 🛠 AWS Services Used
- Route 53 (DNS Management)
- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
- EC2 Auto Scaling Groups
- CloudWatch (Monitoring)
- Lambda (Optional extension)
- S3 (Optional for static content)

## 🔄 Architecture Components

### Frontend
- DNS Query handling through Route 53
- Load balancing across multiple Availability Zones
- Health checks for service reliability

### Backend
- Auto Scaling Group across 3 AZs
- Target groups for load distribution
- Monitoring and logging system

## 📝 Implementation Details

### 1. DNS Configuration
- Route 53 alias record setup
- DNS health checks implementation
- Multi-region routing capability

### 2. Load Balancing
- Application Load Balancer configuration
- Health check parameters
- SSL/TLS certificate integration

### 3. Auto Scaling
- Launch template configuration
- Scaling policies setup
- Multi-AZ deployment (eu-west-1, 2, 3)

### 4. Monitoring
- CloudWatch metrics implementation
- Custom metrics for temperature data
- Health check alerts

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide
1. DNS resolution issues
2. Load balancer health checks
3. Auto scaling triggers
4. Instance health monitoring

## 🔍 Features

- IAM role management
- Regular security updates

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- Response time < 200ms
- 99.99% availability
- Auto scaling threshold at 70% CPU
- Cross-zone load balancing

## 💻 Technical Requirements
- AWS Account
- Domain name
- SSL certificate
- Temperature data source API

## ⚠️ Limitations
