# 🧾 AWS Receipt Processing Solution
*Inspired by Tech With Lucy*

## 🎯 Project Overview
Automated receipt processing pipeline using AWS services to extract text from receipts, store the data, and receive email notifications.

## 🛠 AWS Services Used
- S3 (Storage)
- Lambda (Serverless Computing)
- Textract (OCR Service)
- DynamoDB (NoSQL Database)
- SES (Simple Email Service)
- IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- CloudWatch (Monitoring and Logging)

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Upload receipt (PDF) to designated S3 bucket
2. S3 event triggers Lambda function
3. Lambda invokes Textract for text extraction
4. Extracted data stored in DynamoDB
5. Notification email sent via SES

## 📝 Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. S3 Setup
- Create S3 bucket for receipt storage
- Configure S3 event notifications to trigger Lambda
- Enable versioning (optional)

### 2. Lambda Configuration
- Create Python 3.9 Lambda function
- Set up S3 trigger
- Configure environment variables
- Set appropriate timeout (recommended: 30s)

### 3. IAM Setup
- Create IAM role for Lambda with permissions for:
  - S3 read access
  - Textract full access
  - DynamoDB write access
  - SES send access
  - CloudWatch logs

### 4. DynamoDB
- Create table with appropriate partition key
- Configure read/write capacity units

### 5. SES Configuration
- Verify email address
- Move out of sandbox (if needed)
- Set up email templates (optional)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide
1. Check CloudWatch logs for Lambda execution errors
2. Common issues:
   - Timeout errors: Increase Lambda timeout
   - Permission errors: Verify IAM roles
   - S3 trigger issues: Check bucket configuration
   - Textract region availability: Ensure using supported region

## 🔍 Potential Use Cases
1. Business Expense Management
2. Accounting Automation
3. Receipt Organization for Tax Purposes
4. Financial Record Keeping
5. Expense Report Generation

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
- Add receipt categorization
- Implement cost analysis
- Create visualization dashboard
- Add mobile upload capability
- Multi-language support

## 🔒 Important Notes
- Project runs in eu-east-1 (or any Textract-supported region)
- Ensure proper security measures for sensitive data
- Regular monitoring of AWS costs recommended

## 📚 Resources
- AWS Documentation
- Tech With Lucy Tutorial Reference
- Python Boto3 Documentation

## 💻 Technical Requirements
- AWS Account
- Python 3.9
- Basic AWS services knowledge
- PDF format receipts

## ⚠️ Limitations
- PDF format only
- Single region deployment
- Basic text extraction
- Email notification to single address
